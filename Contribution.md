# Collaboration & Contributions

Yes, we would love you to contribute to this project.

As the goal of this project to provide a learning experience for those involved, there are a few steps to follow:

  1. Some form of spec/RFC/proposal is required for the development of a service/feature/anything of significant size. For examples, check out the [Issues][issues] tab. This is so people can learn how a project of this size is designed and put together. Also it keeps a record of design/implementation decisions made, which is useful of historical reasons (i.e. someone wants to know why `x` is like it is in `y` years).
  2. For any code contributions, please follow this [guide][gitguide] on how to use `git` and `github` to contribute your changes.
  3. Please contribute to the design discussions, specifically in the [proposals][proposals] but also generally in the [Gitter][gitter]. We are all trying to learn, so if you have some knowledge please feel free to share it.
  4. Please do not include your name in source code. See [explanation][explanation].
